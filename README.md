# Olympics_DE_Prj
## **Problem Statement**
Create a data pipeline by leveraging Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Storage, and an Azure Synapse SQL pool to execute data analysis on the 2021 Olympics dataset.
- The dataset contains information on more than 11,000 athletes representing 743 Teams and competing in 47 sports at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. This dataset contains data on the teams, athletes, coaches, and entries that participated, subdivided by gender.
- The first step in this project is to create an azure storage account and import data files into a container.
- Next, build an azure synapse analytics workspace and an SQL pool.
- Create a data pipeline to feed data into Power BI from SQL pool tables once you load it into Azure storage.
- The final step is creating the dashboard in Power BI and publishing it to an Azure Synapse workspace.
- Find insights among the data

## **Requirements** : Olympics 2021 dataset
- Azure subscription
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Power BI Desktop
- Azure blob storage

### System Requirements
- Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012 R2, or later
- .NET 4.6.2 or later
- Internet Explorer 11 or later
- Memory (RAM): At least 2 GB available, 4 GB or more recommended.
- Display: At least 1440x900 or 1600x900 (16:9) required. Lower resolutions such as 1024x768 or 1280x800 aren't supported, as certain controls (such as closing the startup screen) display beyond those resolutions.
- Windows display settings: If you set your display settings to change the size of text, apps, and other items to more than 100%, you may not be able to see certain dialogs that you must interact with to continue using Power BI Desktop. If you encounter this issue, check your display settings in Windows by going to Settings > System > Display, and use the slider to return display settings to 100%.
- CPU: 1 gigahertz (GHz) 64-bit (x64) processor or better recommended.
- WebView2, if not automatically installed with Power BI Desktop or uninstalled.
